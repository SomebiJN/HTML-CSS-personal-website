              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="intro">I am currently an intermediate software developer at Dell Technologies where I have written code, built and led features and resolved bugs for the past three years. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Memorial University of Newfoundland and I also enjoy expanding my my skillset and have never been one to back down from a challenge at work or in my day-to-day life.</p>

                <h3>Computer Networking</h3>
                <p>I have had about 4 computer networking roles so far. Three of these roles were work terms which I completed at Nokia during my computer engineering program and the most recent role is my current role as a 5G Software Developer. More about these roles is linked in my <a href="work-history.html">Work Experience</a> section.
                    Due to these past and current roles, I have both hardware and software experience in dealing with routers and other aspects of computer network architecture. Some tools I have gained during these roles are:
                    <li>C++, Java, Python</li>
                    <li>Agile Software Development</li>
                    <li>Data structures and Algorithms</li>
                    <li>Distributed Computing</li>
                </p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>Not only have I completed personal projects to improve my web development skills, I have also completed The Complete 2023 Web Developemnt Bootcamp by Angela Yu. I have gotten immense understanding of all the elements that make up a website. Some of the tools I have under my belt are:
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap</li>
                        <li>React.js & Node.js</li>
